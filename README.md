# COVID-19-Analysis

A simple analysis of the data from the pandemic

The data available to us today makes it great to study the evolution of the disease, and by doing so learning and applying to Python
some great math and problem solving techniques.

This project is meant to give an overvview of the current situation of the pandemic, try to intepret it's data and predict outcomes. It makes
use of data fitting and mathematical modeeling. 

I will update the notebook when I can add new material or improve current interpretations.
